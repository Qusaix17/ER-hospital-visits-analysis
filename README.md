# üè•ER-Hospital-Visits-Analysis

This project serves as a practical exercise in data collection, cleaning, querying, and visualization. I initially started it to study trends in ER visits based on tourism. However, due to the inability to find reliable open data, I shifted the focus to hospital data. This change allowed me to practice and improve my skills in data collection, cleaning, and using SQL and Power BI.

## When Did I Start This Project?

I began this project towards the end of my journey in the Google Professional Data Analysis course, aiming to apply what I had learned and further develop my experience working with data. The [Methodology](Methodology.md) I used is based on the Google course.

## Findings

Although the data I collected was limited and some were missing, I decided to proceed with the project. I was concerned that I might forget some steps and skills from the course, so I didn‚Äôt stop but instead adjusted the goal and purpose of the project.

### Note: All hospital data consists of ER visits from five hospitals between 2020 and 2023. was collected from MNGH open data.

- **King Fahad Hospital** recorded the highest [visits](PowerBI.md) and [revisits](PowerBI.md).
- **Gender analysis** showed that females recorded more ER visits than males.
- **Age group analysis** revealed that young adult females, adult females, and middle-aged females had the highest visit rates, while elderly males, teens, and children had the highest visits.
- **General age group analysis** shows that across all genders, young adults, middle-aged adults, and teens were the highest visitors to the ER.

## Tools Used

- **SQLite**: For querying required data and preparing it for visualization.
- **Python**: Used to create a changelog and convert the hospital data into an SQLite dataset.
- **Excel**: For cleaning the data and preparing it for SQL.
- **Power BI**: Although I was taught to use Tableau, I found Power BI more comfortable and managed to find good courses online.
